Introduction

Welcome to the Logic World.

A tautology is a proposition with type parameters that has a proof regardless of whether its parameters have a proof. For instance, the proposition `P → P` is a tautology, because the identity function `fun p => p` is a proof of `P → P`.

In this world, we prove a few tautologies.
