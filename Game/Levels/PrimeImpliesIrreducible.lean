World "PrimeImpliesIrreducible"
Title "PrimeImpliesIrreducible"

Introduction
"
Welcome to the PrimeImpliesIrreducible World.

In this world, you will work through a series of levels that explore basic properties of divisibility in the natural numbers. Each level builds on the previous one:
- Level 1 introduces the cancellation law.
- Level 2 shows that equality implies divisibility.
- Level 3 covers a substitution property.
- Level 4 and Level 5 establish unit properties.
- Level 6 brings these concepts together to prove that every prime number is irreducible.
