# Game Skeleton

This is a template for creating a game with [lean4game](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/). It contains a single Level plus the files needed for a local development setup.

The documentation about how to use this template are at the [lean4game repository](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/):

* [Creating a new game](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/blob/main/doc/create_game.md)
  * [Updating an existing game](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/blob/main/doc/update_game.md)
  * [Running a game locally](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/blob/main/doc/running_locally.md)

## Quick start

- Log into GitHub and click the "Use this template" > "Create a new repository" button.
- Once you've created your repo from this template, click the green "Code" button and
  choose "Codespaces" > "Create codespace on main".
- After a few minutes, your Codespace should be ready for you to work on.
  A tab should automatically open with a preview of your game; if your game appears
  to be empty, wait around a minute then refresh (the server can take some time to set up).
